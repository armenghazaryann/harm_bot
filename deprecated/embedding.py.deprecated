DEPRECATED: Custom embedding entity - REPLACED BY LANGCHAIN PGVECTOR

This file is disabled in favor of LangChain's PGVector implementation
to reduce boilerplate and eliminate duplicate embeddings architectures.

LangChain PGVector automatically manages:
- Vector table creation and schema
- HNSW index creation and optimization
- Embedding storage and retrieval
- Distance/similarity calculations

To re-enable custom embeddings:
1. Uncomment the class definition below
2. Add back embeddings relationship in chunk.py
3. Update indexing.py to create custom embeddings table indexes
4. Handle migration between LangChain and custom tables
"""

# ALL CODE REMOVED - Completely replaced by LangChain PGVector
# No custom embedding entity needed - LangChain handles everything automatically
