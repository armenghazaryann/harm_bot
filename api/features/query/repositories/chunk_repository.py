DEPRECATED: Custom chunk repository - REPLACED BY LANGCHAIN PGVECTOR

This repository is obsolete and replaced by LangChain PGVector automatic document management:

REPLACED BY:
- LangChain PGVector handles document storage and retrieval automatically
- LangChain RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter manages optimal chunking
- LangChain Document objects with metadata replace custom chunk entities
- LangChain EnsembleRetriever provides Vector Store + BM25 hybrid search

All chunk functionality is now handled seamlessly by LangChain components
with superior performance and no custom repository code needed.
